# What Threadbear does on your Mac

Everything Threadbear installs, runs in the background, reads, and talks to
over the network. It's here so you, or the agent installing it for you, can
check the code against it before running anything. If the code does
something that isn't on this list, treat that as a problem and say so.
File references are where to look.

## What setup and install add

- **Git remotes** (`scripts/setup.mjs`, "Your copy"): Mike's repo becomes
  `upstream`. If `gh` is logged in and you cloned rather than forked, setup
  forks the repo to your GitHub account (`gh repo fork --remote`).
- **Packages:** `npm ci` in the repo, in `runner/`, and in each runner
  release. esbuild and fsevents have install scripts.
- **Convex, in your own account:** a login (`~/.convex/config.json`), a
  project with a production deployment, a deploy key, and one environment
  variable (`RUNNER_KEY`). It deploys `convex/` and the `web/` site there.
  A second Mac set up with `--existing` gets none of these: its runner's
  key comes from your first Mac (`tb runner add`), which also writes the
  deployment's address into its `runner.json`.
  If that login goes missing or expires, the Convex panel's Sign in to
  Convex button runs `convex login` again from the runner, which writes
  the same file; you approve it in your browser on auth.convex.dev.
- **Or a self-hosted backend** (`setup --self-hosted`, docs/self-hosting.md;
  Convex cloud is the one we recommend): no Convex login or deploy key.
  Instead two Docker containers, `threadbear-convex` (Convex's open source
  backend) and `threadbear-convex-dashboard`, from pinned
  `ghcr.io/convex/*` images, with the data in the Docker volume
  `threadbear-convex-data`. They listen on this Mac's loopback only
  (ports 13210, 13211 and 16791), and `tailscale serve` puts them on your
  tailnet as `https://<this Mac>.<tailnet>.ts.net` ports 3210 (the API),
  3211 (the website) and 6791 (the dashboard), so nothing is reachable off
  your tailnet. The backend's admin key is in
  `secrets/convex-self-hosted.env`, and setup sets `PUSH_RELAY=off` on it,
  as the push relay only works with Convex cloud. runner.json gets
  `sync.site`, the website's address.
- **Apps:** `~/Applications/Threadbear.app` and
  `~/Applications/Threadbear Runner.app`, both built and signed on your Mac.
- **A LaunchAgent:** `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.mikerosoft.threadbear.runner.plist`,
  which keeps the runner going while you're logged in. A runner on a Linux
  server (INSTALL.md, section 6) has a systemd user service in its place,
  `~/.config/systemd/user/com.mikerosoft.threadbear.runner.service`, and no
  apps; it converts pictures with ImageMagick and rsvg-convert, and reads
  the account's full name from `getent passwd` rather than `id -F`.
- **A command:** `~/.local/bin/threadbear`.
- **Files:** the data folder `~/Library/Application Support/Threadbear`
  (threads, settings, `secrets/`, runner releases, the pinned release key
  `upstream-signers`, and `sync-sent.json`, hashes of what's already in your
  Convex mirror so a restart sends only what changed, and
  `shared-pools.json`, the last pools your Convex backend had, which every
  runner shares, so one starts with them while the backend can't be reached,
  and `shortcuts.json`, the keyboard shortcuts you've changed in Settings >
  Keyboard, which the app reads and writes and never sends anywhere, and
  with the standing instructions experiment on, `instructions.md`, which every
  agent is given, and `instructions.sig`, which says Settings saved it). In `secrets/`, `asked/` holds the answers you
  type into an agent's secret card, one owner-only file each with a small
  script beside it that prints it for `sudo -A`, removed after 24 hours,
  and `secret-box.key` is the key your phone seals those answers to;
  `made-deploy-keys` lists, by name, the deploy keys this Mac made (setup's
  and the Convex panel's), so `tb runner rotate-owner` can tell them from
  others;
  `convex-key` is this Mac's key for your Convex backend (the deployment's
  `RUNNER_KEY` on your first Mac, a runner key of its own on any other);
  `runners/<id>.token` is another Mac's runner token, if you copied one
  in (only for Settings > Runners > Connect to other machines directly;
  by default another Mac's threads come through your Convex backend, read
  by your first Mac's runner while one is open, and nothing connects to
  that Mac), and `runners/<id>.host` beside it, which you copy in too (`tb pair`
  on that Mac prints both): the only host the app sends that token to.
  The app only reads these, and proves it has the token rather than
  sending it (docs/protocol.md, "Auth"); with no `.host` it dials nowhere;
  `~/Library/Caches/Threadbear/update`;
  `~/Library/Caches/Threadbear/remote` (copies of pictures and files from
  threads on your other Macs, at most 512 MB, unused ones go after 30 days);
  `~/Library/Caches/Threadbear/rich` (pictures of the ```` ```mermaid ```` and
  ```` ```html ```` blocks in replies, and each one's page for the side pane,
  newest 900 files kept). They're drawn on this Mac in web views that load
  nothing from the network: the diagram library, [Pele](https://pele.run/),
  is bundled with the app (`Resources/Rich/pele.js`, MIT), and a block's
  page runs no scripts;
  `~/Library/Logs/threadbear-runner.log` and `threadbear-update.log`;
  `~/Library/Logs/Threadbear/hangs` (the last 10 times the app froze: if its
  main thread is stuck for 4 seconds it runs macOS's `sample` on itself, in
  a sandbox, and notes the main thread's priority, the Mac's load average
  and how long since the last keyboard or mouse input (just how long, never
  what); nothing else ever reads these); and `~/ThreadbearThreads`, the default
  folder for new threads. A folder you open from a link in the side pane
  is listed, and watched for changes only while it's showing, and macOS may
  ask for permission the first time that's somewhere like Documents. The runner also runs `vm_stat` and `sw_vers` on a Mac, or reads `/proc/meminfo` and `/etc/os-release` on Linux, for the memory and system figures in the website's Runners view and the Mac app's runner details (`runner/src/runner-stats.ts`), every 5 minutes and while either is open. It also runs `ps`, and `sample` (in a
  sandbox, through `sandbox-exec`) on a thread's own CLI, when a turn has been quiet for a minute,
  to tell a CLI frozen on a macOS prompt from a long job. The sample is a
  temp file, deleted straight after. Taking over from a draining runner
  older than 5 Nov 2026, it runs `lsof` on that runner's pid once, to check
  the connection it's about to send the token over is really that runner's.
  `mac-screen.json` in the data folder
  remembers what it's said about dialogs on the screen (below).

Connectors setup is an experiment, off by default (`connectorsSetup`).
Only when you press Set up in the Connectors panel, a thread clones
plugbear (github.com/mikecann/plugbear, at the one commit
`runner/src/connectors-catalog.ts` pins) into
`~/Library/Application Support/Threadbear/plugbear-src` and runs its own
installer, which puts the gateway and its config, secrets and state in
`~/Library/Application Support/Connectors/`, a LaunchAgent
(`local.connectors`) that keeps it listening on 127.0.0.1:8795 only, and a
`connectors` command in `~/.local/bin`. Its `install-clients.sh` adds a
`connectors` MCP server to each login's Claude Code config (and Codex's
and the Grok CLI's), with a helper that reads each login's token from the
Keychain. The thread also sets `connectors.url` in `runner.json`. Each Add
in the panel is a thread that edits the gateway's `upstreams.json` and
restarts it. plugbear's README says how to take it all out.

With Local connectors on as well (`localConnectors`, off by default), an
Add for a local server (Blender, or a `uvx` or `npx` package you name at
one exact version) is a thread that writes a `stdio` upstream to the
gateway's `upstreams.json` and an ask rule to its `policy.json`. From
then on the gateway runs that command as a child of the
`local.connectors` LaunchAgent, as you, whenever it's running, and logs
its output to `~/Library/Logs/connectors.log`; `uvx` and `npx` download
the pinned package from PyPI or npm the first time. If `uv` isn't
installed the thread installs it with Homebrew, and Blender's thread
copies the MCP for Blender add-on into Blender's add-ons folder. The
runner looks for `uvx` or `npx` in `~/.local/bin`, `/opt/homebrew/bin`,
`/usr/local/bin` and `~/.cargo/bin`, then asks your login shell, and
reads the gateway's `upstreams.json` (only each upstream's id and type)
to know which services are local.

With Outside agents on (`outsideAgents`), the runner keeps which agent key
started which thread in `runner/agent-threads.json` (0600) in the data
folder.

## What runs in the background

- **Landing work** (`runner/src/worktrees.ts`): `tb land` keeps an empty
  `threadbear-land.lock` in the repo's common git directory. It runs
  macOS's `lockf` (Linux's `flock`) with a small Node child to hold an OS
  lock from before rebasing until the check and fast-forward finish.
  Another landing waits; exiting, including a crash, releases the lock.
- **The runner** listens on `127.0.0.1:8797` only, and needs a token
  (`runner/src/config.ts`). It starts the official `claude` and `codex`
  CLIs for your threads.
- **Agents get full access by default.** Claude runs with
  `bypassPermissions` and Codex with `danger-full-access`. "Ask before
  edits" is a choice for each thread.
- **Your phone and browser can drive the Mac.** A paired iPhone or a
  signed-in browser can start threads in any folder, send messages and
  answer approvals, through your Convex deployment (`runner/src/sync.ts`).
  Those threads start on full access like any other, so treat a pairing like
  a login to the Mac, and so is admin access to your Convex deployment.
  Pairings last 90 days unless set otherwise, at most 365
  (`convex/tokens.ts`); Revoke in Settings › Phone & browser ends one.
- **Following your main** (`runner/src/update.ts`, `app/Sources/Threadbear/AppUpdate.swift`):
  the runner and the app watch your local `main`, and look again every 5
  minutes. Within seconds of it changing, they rebuild themselves from it
  and redeploy your backend, so whatever reaches your `main` runs, with no
  signature check; only Mike's release tags are signed (below). Turn it
  off for both with `followMain: false` in `runner.json` (ask any thread
  to; it left Settings on 2 Nov). Around each step of the runner's build
  it reads macOS's sleep count (`pmset -g stats`, which changes nothing),
  so a step that failed while the Mac slept is tried again later (up to
  three times for the same commit) rather than taken as a broken main.
- **Schedule checks** (`runner/src/schedule-check.ts`, experiment
  `scheduleChecks`, off by default): a schedule's check command runs in
  `/bin/sh` before each run, as you, for at most a minute (or up to five,
  if the schedule says). Each keeps a
  state file (and a note that a held check was told about, `<id>.held`) in `schedule-checks/` in Threadbear's data folder, and
  beside it what the check last printed (`<id>.<hash>.kept.json`, readable
  only by you) until a run carrying it has been sent, and, while a check
  runs, which runner process is running it (`<id>.running.json`).
- **Keeping the Mac awake** (`runner/src/keep-awake.ts`, experiment
  `keepAwake`, off by default): while a thread is working and for 3
  minutes after, the runner runs macOS's `/usr/bin/caffeinate -i -w
  <runner pid>`, which stops idle sleep only (the display still sleeps
  and the screen still locks). While it does, it reads `pmset -g batt`
  every 2 minutes and lets go on battery below 15%.
- **Mike's releases** (`runner/src/upstream.ts`): every 6 hours it lists
  `upstream`'s `release/*` tags, fetches the newest few into a folder of
  their own (`<home>/runner/upstream-fetch`, deleted after each check),
  checks each with `ssh-keygen -Y verify` against the pinned key (the
  signature goes in a temp file under `$TMPDIR` for a moment), and copies
  the newest that passes into your checkout, as `refs/threadbear/upstream/`. It never changes your code by
  itself. Every 5 days, when there's one your copy doesn't have, it starts
  one thread (on your own Claude or Codex login, like any thread) that
  merges it in a worktree, runs the checks and asks you before it lands
  (`runner/src/bring-in.ts`). A release Mike marks important starts one
  straight away. Settings › General › Updates from Mike, or
  `"releases": { "bringIn": 14 }` (or `"important"`, or `"off"`) in
  `runner.json`, changes it. It keeps what it last did in
  `runner/bring-in.json` in the data folder.
- **CLI updates** (`runner/src/updates/`): every hour it checks for new
  Claude Code and Codex versions and installs them. If you don't point it
  at your own Codex, it installs one into the data folder. It also runs
  any update commands you list under `cliUpdates.extra` in `runner.json`
  (none unless you add them), once a day each, and keeps when each last
  ran in `extra-updates.json` in the data folder.
  `THREADBEAR_CLI_UPDATES=off` stops all of this.
- **Small model calls** (`runner/src/models/`): thread titles, filing
  threads into projects (the librarian, every 5 minutes) and similar jobs
  send short excerpts of your threads to `claude -p` on your own logins.
  When a project's notes pass 12,000 characters, the librarian sends them
  the same way to be rewritten shorter, and keeps the old notes in the
  data folder's `project-notes/` (the last 5 for each project).
  Mike's publishing runner also sends commit messages to Opus through its
  Claude pool when preparing a daily release, to write the plain-language release notes.
  The input includes subjects and bodies of merged commits, including pull requests.
  If that call fails, the signed release still goes out without notes.
- **Housekeeping** (`runner/src/housekeeping.ts`): trims logs, deletes
  week-old copies of pictures pasted into drafts (a sent message keeps its
  own copy) and deleted threads after 30 days in the trash. Archived
  threads keep their pictures unless you set `"archivedMediaDays": <days>`
  in `runner.json`.
- **Moving threads** (the `moveToRunner` experiment, off by default;
  `runner/src/moves.ts`): watches your Convex deployment for threads you've
  moved to or from this machine. One moving away is packed (its folder,
  its Claude transcript, its worktree's git work), sealed to the other
  machine's key, uploaded in pieces and deleted from the deployment once
  it lands; this machine keeps its old copy in `moved/` in the data folder
  for a week. One arriving is unpacked in `moves/` first, and may make a
  worktree for it, write its transcript into a login's Claude folder, and
  `git clone` its repo from `origin` if this machine has no copy.
- **Presence** (`runner/src/presence.ts`): reads how long the keyboard and
  mouse have been idle (`ioreg`), so your phone knows whether you're at
  the Mac.
- **Dialogs on the screen** (`runner/src/mac-screen.ts`): every 2 minutes it
  runs `osascript` to count the windows of macOS's UserNotificationCenter, so
  it can tell you when a dialog has been left waiting. It sees how many, not
  what they say. `THREADBEAR_MAC_SCREEN=off` stops it.
- **Patches** (`.threadbear/patches/`): code from a folder runs only after
  you trust that folder (`runner/src/patch-trust.ts`). A folder's Claude
  Code hooks, other commands, `env` settings and (in Ask and Auto threads)
  permission rules in its `.claude/settings*.json`, its `.mcp.json`
  servers, and hooks in its `.claude/agents`, `skills` and `commands`, are
  held back the same way (`runner/src/claude-trust.ts`): the runner reads
  those files and the scripts they reach to hash them, runs `git ls-files`
  in the folder to find skills in folders under it, and keeps what you
  trusted in the same `patch-trust.json`.
- **Menus on macOS 27.2** (`app/Sources/Threadbear/DragSpace.swift`): every
  5 seconds, and before a button opens a menu, the app asks the window
  server which Spaces its own windows are on, and takes them off the drag
  Space a window drag can leave them on, which hides their menus. A window
  filed under another display's Space than the one it's on (after a
  restart in the background) is put on its own display's. These are
  private window server calls, and they only touch the app's own windows.

## What it reads

- From your Claude and Codex logins: which account each is (the email in
  `~/.claude.json`), a few settings, and the token counts in your session
  transcripts, so it can show how much room each login has
  (`runner/src/accounts.ts`, `runner/src/token-tally.ts`;
  `THREADBEAR_TOKEN_TALLY=off` stops the counting). It never reads or
  copies login tokens or the Keychain.
- Token Stats' files, if you have that app, and any logins you've added
  under `accounts` in its data folder (`claude-1`, `codex-1`...).
- Your first name, from your Mac account's full name (`id -F`), so its
  agents know what to call you (`runner/src/user-name.ts`). It stays in
  the instructions your own threads get.
- Whether it has Full Disk Access, by opening macOS's permissions database
  (`~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db`) and closing it
  again. It never reads it. Without the access macOS refuses, with no prompt.
- Whether `Threadbear.app` is in `/Applications` or `~/Applications`, as a Mac
  without it is probably one nobody sits at.
- The `.env*` files in the folders your threads work in (the folder, the
  folders directly inside it, and up to its repo's root; not `.env.example`
  and the like, your home folder or external drives), and everything in its
  own `secrets/` folder, to know what to take out of text before it goes to
  your Convex deployment (`runner/src/secret-values.ts`). Looked at when a
  folder first turns up, when a thread has just touched a file of secrets
  (including a `.env` in a folder of its choosing), and otherwise at most
  every 5 minutes. Kept in memory, never logged, written down or sent anywhere.

## Who it talks to

| Service | Whose | What goes there |
|---|---|---|
| Your Convex deployment | yours | Thread titles and status, all message text (each message cut at 8,000 characters), one line per tool call, projects, schedules, your logins' emails and usage, whether you're at the Mac, whether this machine is low on memory or disk, and the pictures you paste into a message, up to 10 MB each, so your own website can show them. Those go up as they are, in your deployment's file storage: unlike text, nothing can scrub a secret out of a picture, so a screenshot of something sensitive goes too. `"sync": { "pastedPictures": false }` in `runner.json` keeps them on this Mac. While someone has the website's Runners view open, this machine's CPU, memory and disk use, its processor model, operating system and time since it started, every 10 seconds; with nobody looking, none of that is sent. Photos you send from the phone, and pictures you send from the Mac app to a thread on another of your Macs, deleted once that Mac has fetched them. Pictures and videos agents put in their replies or pin, at most 10 MB each, for the phone to show. Other images only for threads you share by link. Other tool output and files stay on the Mac, unless you move a thread to another of your machines (the `moveToRunner` experiment): then the whole thread, sealed so only that machine can open it, goes through for as long as the move takes. Text has known secrets taken out first: see below. |
| Convex (the Convex panel) | yours | Only for a thread in a Convex project, when its Convex panel opens: the runner's Convex CLI asks api.convex.dev for the project's deployments and a deploy key, the runner asks the deployment whether a kept key still works (`/api/check_admin_key`), and the panel loads Convex's embedded dashboard (dashboard-embedded.convex.dev) with that key. Sign in to Convex goes to auth.convex.dev. (`runner/src/convex-keys.ts`) |
| Your other Macs, over ssh | yours | Only when you run `tb runner add <name> --ssh <host>` or `tb runner check --ssh <host>` on your first Mac: it reads that Mac's Threadbear `runner.json`, writes its id and the deployment's address there if it hasn't them, writes its new key into that Mac's `secrets/convex-key`, and looks whether that Mac has a deploy key, Convex panel keys or a Convex login (names only, never a key), through your own ssh setup with agent and port forwarding off (`runner/src/runner-keys.ts`). `tb runner audit` asks this Mac's runner for its threads' last seqs and your deployment for what the main key made. `tb runner rotate-owner` sets env vars on your deployment with your deploy key, and, if you give it a Convex team access token for that run (`CONVEX_TEAM_TOKEN`, never kept), asks api.convex.dev for the deployment's deploy keys (their names and dates) before it rotates. |
| GitHub | Mike's repo | Release tags fetched every 6 hours; the fork at setup |
| downloads.claude.ai, registry.npmjs.org | Anthropic, npm | CLI version checks and installs; `npm ci` |
| Anthropic, OpenAI | yours | Your threads, through the official CLIs on your own logins. With the `cardReviewer` experiment on (off by default), an approval card in a thread on Auto, with the thread's first and latest messages, goes to Opus through the same CLI so it can decide in your place. With the `labReview` experiment on (off by default), a thread's code change, with your message and the agent's reply, goes to your other provider's CLI as a review thread, as if you'd started one. After a turn fails because the API couldn't be reached, the runner itself opens (and straight away closes) a connection to api.anthropic.com or chatgpt.com on port 443, at most once a minute, until one opens and the thread carries on. Nothing is sent over it (`runner/src/net-probe.ts`). |
| Mike's push relay | Mike's | Only when a paired iPhone gets a notification. It's sent from your Convex deployment, not the Mac. The text is encrypted for the phone; the relay sees the device token and thread id (`convex/push.ts`, `docs/push-relay.md`). The first time, your deployment registers with it, giving its own address; the relay keeps that address and checks it by posting a one-time code back to your deployment's `/relay/verify` (`convex/http.ts`). |
| A Connectors gateway | whoever runs it | Only if one is set in `runner.json` or `~/.claude.json`. Its `/health` every few minutes (and once more at the end of a turn where a call to one of its services failed, to see if it needs signing in), and for a project with a Notion page, a Notion read or two every 5 minutes for its task board (`runner/src/notion-tasks.ts`), signed with the header the `headersHelper` command in that `connectors` entry prints, which it runs for each read |
| Your backend's `/mcp`, from outside agents | Convex, and the agents you give a key (Grok Bot runs at xAI) | Only with the Outside agents experiment on and a key made in the Connectors panel. An agent with a key can list and read threads (only ones it started, unless you allow all), and with a write key start Ask-mode threads and message those. What it reads goes to that agent's company. Keys are stored as hashes, expire, and are revoked from the panel |
| Sentry | Mike's | Nothing from your copy. Only a copy whose `origin` is Mike's own repo reports errors or uploads the app's debug symbols (`runner/src/sentry.ts`, `app/Sources/Threadbear/CrashReporting.swift`, `app/build-app.sh`). The App Store iPhone app sends anonymous crash reports. |

An HTML file opened in the side pane (a mockup or report an agent made,
a page in a project) talks to nothing. It loads through the app's own
`threadbear-preview:` scheme, which serves only that page and the
styles, pictures, fonts and media its markup names in its folder:
never another page, a script file, SVG, a dotfile, a symlink or a file
outside it. Its web view
blocks every other load (a WebKit content rule list, which WebKit keeps
in its own store under `~/Library/WebKit`), sends any connection it would
still make to a closed port on this Mac (127.0.0.1:9) so no name is
looked up, runs none of the page's scripts (unless you choose Run them
over that page, which turns them on for that version of the file only,
remembered by its SHA-256 in the app's settings), has WebRTC off, and doesn't
follow links away from it, submit
forms, open windows or download
(`app/Sources/Threadbear/Views/LocalPreviewSchemeHandler.swift`,
`app/Sources/ThreadbearCore/Support/LocalPreviewSite.swift`).

On the Mac itself, a web link you click in the app first goes to
BrowserBear's socket (`~/Library/Application Support/BrowserBear/browserbear.sock`),
if you have BrowserBear, to ask whether an agent's Chrome tab is already
on that page (`app/Sources/Threadbear/BrowserBear.swift`). Only the link
goes there.

The Browser panel also uses that private socket to list the pages agents
associate with threads, ask for a small still of each and bring a page's real
window to the front (`app/Sources/Threadbear/Views/AgentBrowserPanel.swift`).
Threadbear does not read Chrome's cookie database or copy credentials, and
stills stay on this Mac, in memory, not sent to Convex. BrowserBear stores
thread/tab/profile associations in `panel-tabs.json` in its own folder (0600).

The agents' own browser (`browserbear ... --profile agent`) is Helium where it's
installed, else Google Chrome, with its own profile folder; the panel reads
`agent/tabs.json` in BrowserBear's folder for its pages. Any program on this Mac
could reach its local debugging port, so it holds only what you sign it in to.

Nothing else: no analytics, no ads, no tracking.

## Secrets and your Convex deployment

Before any text goes to your deployment, the runner takes out what it can
recognise (`runner/src/scrub.ts`): shapes of keys and tokens
(`runner/src/redaction.ts`) and the actual values in `.env` files and its own
`secrets/` folder. Your deployment does the shape check again before storing it
(`convex/redaction.ts`), so an older runner can't put a known shape there. Your
own copy on the runner keeps every word. If the check itself fails, that text
isn't sent, and `tb status` says so.

**It isn't a guarantee.** It catches shapes and values it knows, so a secret in
an unfamiliar format can get through, and it can't read pictures at all: any
picture that goes up (ones agents post or pin, and anything in a thread you
share) goes as it is. Scrubbing also can't undo a leak. A key that shows up in
a thread has already been to the AI provider, so rotate it.

**Full sync** is off unless a runner's `runner.json` has `"sync": { "full": true }`.
With it off, tool output, diffs and tool screenshots stay on that runner, and
nothing below happens. With it on, from then on (older tools aren't sent), that
runner also sends each finished tool's output, its full input, its diffs and the
reasoning before it to your deployment, after the same scrubbing, where they're
kept 30 days. This lets you read them from any device while the runner's off. It's
the same not-a-guarantee as above, over much more text. A tool whose command or file
can hold secrets (`.env` files, `env list`, key files: `runner/src/withhold.ts`) sends
nothing of itself, and a runner without an on-device model relies on these checks
alone, which `tb status` says. A tool's screenshots stay on the runner unless you tap
one on the website, which uploads that one for a day.

`runner/scripts/scrub-stored.mjs` runs today's rules over what's already stored,
and only when you run it. Convex backups and snapshot exports keep their copies.

There's also a silent on-device check, off unless `runner.json` has
`secretCheck: { enabled: true }`, on a Mac with Apple Intelligence
(`runner/src/secret-check.ts`). It's an experiment: it builds a small helper the
first time (`<data>/tools/secret-check/`), and on mains power, at background
priority, it passes a sample of tool output and pictures to Apple's on-device
model, and Apple's on-device text recognition for a picture. Nothing leaves the
Mac and it changes nothing that uploads. It keeps counts, and the thread and
sequence number of what it flagged, in `<data>/secret-check.json`. Never the text.
