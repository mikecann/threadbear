# With several hosts (Mike's are Tinker Desk and the cloud box), each run
# goes to the first one that's free and can run it, or waits for the first
# that can, and leaves that line for another that frees up before its turn
# comes (leave_line, below). A Linux host only takes what needs no Mac: a --quick run that
# doesn't touch ios/, app/ or dock/ (each brings in Swift), with no --shots.
# Mike asked on 6 Nov, when nine threads' checks queued at once.
#
# Mike asked on 6 Nov 2026, after three threads' unit suites, a swift test
# and three debug apps took his M5 to a load of 75 and a test's window came
# up over his browser. The host he picked (Tinker Desk) is also where he
# tries clean installs of Threadbear, so a run leaves nothing behind that
# looks like an install: no runner, no data dir, no checkout. Each run
# copies this checkout's files (tracked and untracked, as check.sh sees
# them) into ~/.cache/threadbear-check/runs/<id> there, runs check.sh on
# it, and deletes it. What's kept there between runs is only what makes
# the next run quick: node_modules per lockfile, the Swift build folders,
# and a mirror of each checkout that sends to it (mirror/<key>), so a run
# sends only what changed since that checkout's last, compressed: a whole
# copy is 17 MB, and on a congested link (6 Nov) that took minutes. Each
# run's copy is made from the mirror there. Delete ~/.cache/threadbear-check
# to take it all away.
#
# One run at a time on the host (lockf); a second waits and says so. The
# copy always runs from the same path, src/, as SwiftPM's build cache only
# works where it was made. Logs of failed steps, and --shots, come back
# here. --e2e never comes here: it needs the claude login, and on Tinker
# Desk a CLI signed in over SSH broke the desktop's login (2 Nov), so
# check.sh runs those on this Mac.
#
# A host with too little disk left is passed over (MIN_FREE_GIB, below).
#
# A host that stops answering partway is dropped for the next (`watched`).
#
# The check there stops when this does: it runs under hangup-guard.sh, which
# ends it when this Mac's ssh goes.
#
# Exit 255: no host that can run it could be reached (check.sh then runs here).
# Hosts that were reached but have no room are exit 1, with their free space:
# the M5 isn't the place for it either, and clearing the host is the fix.
